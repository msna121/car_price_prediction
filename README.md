# car_price_prediction
## Overview
This is an end to end project of machine learning using Kaggle data set.

## Objective

## Steps involved:
### Loading data set, exploring and cleaning data:
  1. Obtaining latest data set from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/nehalbirla/vehicle-dataset-from-cardekho/version/3?select=car+data.csv)
  2. Creating a virtual environment
  3. Installing the required libraries
  4. Using jupyter notebook to import the installed libraries, load the data set, explore the data
